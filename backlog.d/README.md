## Dependency Map

```text
001 (annotations) ──┐
                    ├──→ 010 (ramp pattern) ──→ north star
002 (timeline)   ──┘        ↑
                    bb/011 (triage sprite) ──┘
                            ↑
012 (delivery ledger) ──────┘  load-bearing for agent consumers
003 (non-fatal webhooks) — prerequisite for sprite reliability
004 (correlation paths) — prerequisite for sprite signal quality
006 (query split) — enables cleaner annotation-aware queries
007 (dogfooding) — validates 001+002 on real workloads and unblocks 009
009 (desktop health semantics) — selects the non-HTTP model and unblocks 021
011 (OpenAPI) — contract for SDK convergence and agent self-discovery
013 (metrics) — self-observability for dogfooding credibility
014 (DR) — data durability assurance
030 (agent contract safety) — depends on 011 + 012; makes scopes, summaries, cold-start guidance, annotation write-back, and webhook delivery replay machine-verifiable
031 (agent replay determinism) — shipped; malformed cursors, unsafe target cadence, invalid persisted probe methods, and unverifiable boot state fail explicitly before agents trust replay state
032 (live Rust write-path evidence) — follows the Rust production cutover; proves admin/ingest/webhook/monitor/target write paths with replayable evidence packets
033 (deployed service registry lifecycle) — shipped; owned-service monitoring state is timestamped and actionable, with blocked Adminifi and missing Vercel/Fly coverage captured in the registry
034 (worker lifecycle readiness oracle) — makes webhook, target, monitor, retention, and TLS workers visible to readiness/gate checks
035 (deployed app Canary coverage) — ensures every active owned Vercel/Fly deployment is enrolled or explicitly blocked with evidence
036 (agent-native inspection surface) — gives Codex/Claude a stable CLI/JSON/MCP-shaped way to inspect Canary status, errors, incidents, timelines, targets, and dogfood coverage
037 (watch the watchmen) — proves Canary itself from outside the Canary process and preserves receipts when Canary is unreachable
038 (one-command integration agent) — discovers, patches, enrolls, and verifies Canary integration for Vercel/Fly/Next apps

022 (contract hygiene) ──── ships independently; restores summary invariant + supervision-tree collapse
023 (incident detail API) ──→ Canary-side substrate for bb/011 (and thus 010 ramp pattern)
024 (signal-agnostic annotations) ──→ blocked on 023; completes the Ramp-loop writable-metadata primitive
```

## Execution Lanes

**Lane 1 (agent readiness):** 012 (delivery ledger) → bb/011 (triage sprite) → 010 (ramp)
  · **023 (incident detail API) → 024 (signal-agnostic annotations)** land the Canary-side substrate bb/011 consumes
**Lane 2 (contract + observability):** 011 (OpenAPI) + 013 (metrics) — parallel, no deps · **030 (agent contract safety)** depends on 011 + 012 and tightens the existing contract for autonomous consumers · **031 (agent replay determinism)** shipped the malformed replay/query/health contract errors · **032 (live Rust write-path evidence)** proves the Rust production surface beyond read-only smoke
**Lane 3 (structural):** 006 (query split) → 005 (connect-a-service) · **022 (contract hygiene + shallow-module collapse)** — ship first of the active set; unblocks nothing but restores the summary invariant and sheds ~300 LOC of drift
**Lane 4 (hardening):** 008, 014, 016, 017, 018, 019 (independent, small, can ship anytime) · **034 (worker lifecycle readiness oracle)** hardens the Rust background-worker proof surface
**Lane 5 (dogfood coverage):** 020 (Adminifi HTTP surface verification) · **033 (deployed service registry lifecycle)** shipped the managed registry substrate · **035 (deployed app Canary coverage)** makes every active owned deployment covered or explicitly blocked · **036 (agent-native inspection surface)** gives agents the operating view · **037 (watch the watchmen)** proves Canary externally · **038 (one-command integration agent)** removes setup friction

### Active order (2026-06-11)

1. **035** — Deployed app Canary coverage (make the requested deployed applications covered or explicitly blocked)
2. **036** — Agent-native inspection surface (CLI/JSON first, MCP after the schema stabilizes)
3. **037** — Watch the watchmen (external witness for Canary itself)
4. **038** — One-command integration agent (discover, patch, enroll, verify)
5. **030** — Agent contract safety pass (scope annotations, summary completeness, cold-start guidance, annotation write-back; delivery-id lookup already shipped)
6. **032** — Live Rust write-path evidence (prove deployed admin/ingest/webhook/monitor/target paths with sanitized packets)
7. **034** — Worker lifecycle readiness oracle (make Rust background workers visible to readiness and Dagger smoke)

022 + 023 landed on 2026-04-21. 024 landed on 2026-04-22. 026 landed on
2026-04-23 — Ramp
substrate now complete; bb/011 unblocks the north star. Elixir-era lint and
parity backlog items were retired during the Rust scorched-earth migration.
010 stays blocked on bb/011. 020 stays blocked on Adminifi URLs.

## Migration Notes

- Consolidated from `.backlog.d/` on 2026-03-30. Legacy items archived to `.backlog.d/_done/`.
- `.backlog.d/006` (monorepo bootstrap) archived as shipped — commit `c87f28f`.
- `.backlog.d/008` (monitor generation spike) superseded by 010-ramp-pattern.
- Bitterblossom triage sprite tracked at `bitterblossom/backlog.d/011-canary-triage-sprite.md`.
- 2026-04-02: Added 012–015 from multi-AI architecture audit. Promoted 006, 011 to high.
- 2026-04-21: Added 022–024 from grooming investigation (three parallel investigators: archaeologist / strategist / scout). Three themes: contract hygiene, incident-as-atomic-agent-unit, signal-agnostic annotations. 022 ready to ship first; 023 + 024 land the Canary-side substrate for the ramp pattern.
- 2026-05-19: Groomed stale active backlog. Archived 025 as subsumed by #026
  and archived shipped 027. Added 030 from the agent-contract safety theme:
  per-operation scope metadata, summary completeness discipline, cold-start
  guidance, annotation write-back conventions, and delivery-id-addressable
  webhook diagnostics without crossing the responder boundary.
- 2026-05-24: Groomed toward usefulness/elegance: promoted #030, added #031
  for deterministic replay/health/readiness boundary failures, and clarified
  that #010 is now blocked on the downstream bitterblossom triage sprite rather
  than Canary-side annotation/timeline substrate.
- 2026-06-07: Retired Elixir-era active backlog items during the Rust
  scorched-earth migration; Rust-owned Dagger, OpenAPI, and cargo tests are now
  the active contract surfaces.
- 2026-06-11: Groomed the current Rust backlog from `origin/master`, archived
  031 after verifying the Rust replay/health determinism guardrails, kept 030
  focused on missing OpenAPI operation-level scope/guidance metadata, and added
  032-034 for live write-path proof, dogfood registry lifecycle, and worker
  readiness observability.
- 2026-06-11: Follow-up dogfood/watchmen design pass from live Vercel, Fly, and
  Canary evidence. Promoted 033 from static dogfood buckets to a deployed
  service registry, then added 035-038 for exhaustive owned-app coverage,
  agent-native inspection, independent Canary witnessing, and one-command
  integration.
- 2026-06-11: Delivered 033. `priv/dogfood/owned_services.json` is now a
  schema-versioned deployed-service registry; `bin/dogfood-audit` validates it,
  emits text or JSON, and strict-checks active services against live Canary.

## Status

- `ready`: scoped and buildable now
- `blocked`: keep visible, but do not start before the listed dependency lands
- `done`: completed and archived under `_done/`
